				<h2>Overview</h2>
				<p>
					myFlix is a web app, developed using the MERN stack, that provides users with access to information
					about movies, directors, and genres. Users are able to create an account, update their personal data, 
					and create a list of favorite movies
				</p>
				<h2>Purpose and Context</h2>
				<p>
					myFlix was a personal project I built as part of my web development course at CareerFoundry to demonstrate my mastery of full-stack JavaScript development.
				</p>
				<h2>Objective</h2>
				<p>
					The aim of the project was to have an ambitious full-stack project I can add to my professional portfolio. The problem I wanted to solve is to build 
					the complete server-side and client-side for the application from scratch.
				</p>

				<h2>Approach</h2>
				<h3>Back-end</h3>
				<p>
					For this project, I developed a RESTful API using Node.js and Express to interact with a MongoDB database. The API is designed to handle various HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, enabling clients to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
					 operations on a collection of movie information. The primary goal of the API is to serve and manage data about movies in JSON format.
				</p>
				<h4>Technology stack:</h4>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Node.js: </strong>Asynchronous, event-driven JavaScript runtime that handles multiple requests efficiently.</li>
						<li><strong>Express: </strong>Minimalist web framework for Node.js, which simplifies routing and middleware configuration.</li>
						<li><strong>MongoDB: </strong>A NoSQL, non-relational database that stores data in flexible, document-based structures (JSON-like BSON format). Perfect for applications where data structure is not fixed or pre-defined.</li>
					</ul>
				<p>
					To test the functionality of the API, I used Postman, a popular API testing tool that allows for interaction with the API endpoints in an isolated environment. With Postman,
					I tested various API routes and scenarios to ensure the API handled requests and errors as expected.
					Finally, I also tested the authentication flows with both Basic HTTP and JWT authentication to confirm that unauthorized users could not access restricted endpoints.

				<h3>Front-end</h3>
				<p>
					After completing the backend API, I proceeded to build the user interface to allow users to interact with the API. 
					This interface is a single-page application (SPA) developed using React and React-Redux, designed to handle user requests and display responses from the server-side efficiently. 
					The goal was to create a dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly web application that communicates seamlessly with the backend API.
				</p>
				<h4>Technology stack:</h4>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>React: </strong>A powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly well-suited for creating dynamic and interactive SPAs. React uses a component-based architecture, which allowed for better organization and reusability of UI elements.</li>
						<li><strong>React-Redux: </strong>A state management library that works in conjunction with React to handle application-wide state efficiently, making it easier to manage and update UI components based on changes in the data.</li>
						<li><strong>CSS: </strong>For styling the application, ensuring that the layout was both visually appealing and responsive across various devices and screen sizes.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						The SPA is designed to allow users to search for, view, and manage movie information provided by the backend API.
						The user can select a movie to watch, enter this movie to his favorite list or modify their user data.
						By building this single-page application with React and React-Redux, I created a dynamic and responsive interface that seamlessly 
						communicates with the backend API. The use of Redux for state management ensured smooth handling of data and user interactions across the application, 
						while Reactâ€™s component-based architecture made the UI modular and maintainable. The SPA provides an intuitive and user-friendly experience for 
						interacting with movie data, and it showcases how front-end technologies can be combined to build scalable, efficient web applications.

			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>
				This project was both the most rewarding and the most challenging I have undertaken so far. From designing the API 
				and working with database structures to building a responsive client-side interface, I experienced a wide range of technical 
				and conceptual learning curves. Ultimately, the project helped me grow as a developer, enhancing my skills in both backend and frontend development.
				<br>
				<br>
				One of my favorite aspects of this project was building the backend. I enjoyed working with Node.js and Express to create a 
				structured and efficient RESTful API. The flexibility of using MongoDB as a non-relational database allowed me to focus on 
				creating a dynamic schema for movie information without being constrained by the rigid structure of relational databases.
			</p>

		<div>
			<h2>Duration</h2>
			<p>
				Between the back-end and the front-end, I would say that this entire project took me around 20 days for completion.
